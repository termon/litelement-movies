# LitElement Movies

This application aims to demonstrate

1. Development of WebComponents using [LitElement/LitHtml](https://https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/)
2. Use of a WebComponent router [vaadin router](https://vaadin.com/router)
3. Use of ESM module imports and a repository such as [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com), provides a simple development setup experience (node/bundler setup not required)
4. Use of [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) state management with WebComponents. Also uses [@adobe/lit-mobx](https://github.com/adobe/lit-mobx) mixin to simplify reactivity between MobX - WebComponents
5. Use of A Web API [Movie database TmDb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)
